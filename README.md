#Intelligent Car

##Description
The intelligent car is a team project developed by Horatiu Lazu, Richard Dang and Eric Tseng. The vehicle is able to traverse a maze using an Arduino board along with a gearbox, motors, a light dependent resistor and an H-bridge integrated circuit chip. The maze is a set of black lines on a white surface so the LDR can be utilized in order to direct the vehicle by reading the amount of light reflected off the surface of the maze. In order to control the direction of the motors, an H-Bridge logic chip is used.

##Features:
* Single LDR used to traverse through a maze
* Straightfoward algorithm
* Minimal turning radius
* Minimal materials and processing use
